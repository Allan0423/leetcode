### Introduction

On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.  
You can move according to the next rules:  

- In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means - to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

### Constraints

- points.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 100
- points[i].length == 2
- -1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000

### Examples

```
Input: nums = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,0], index = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: 5
```

### Solutions

- My solution

按照题设条件，任意两个点间的行进步数为X坐标距离和Y坐标距离中较大的那个，累加两个点间的距离即可。

```java
private int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points){
        int distance = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            distance += getDistance(points[i - 1], points[i]);
        }
        return distance;
}

private int getDistance(int[] x, int[] y){
    int xDistance = y[0] - x[0] >= 0 ? y[0] - x[0] : x[0] - y[0];
    int yDistance = y[1] - x[1] >= 0 ? y[1] - x[1] : x[1] - y[1];
    return Math.max(xDistance, yDistance);
}
```
